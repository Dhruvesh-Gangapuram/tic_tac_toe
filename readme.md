# Tic Tac Toe

# **Intro**
This project seeks to develop a Tic Tac Toe game with **AI** and **multiplayer features**. The game's AI is built on the min-max algorithm, which allows the computer to make the best plays based on the current state of the game. The multiplayer mode allows two players to compete against one other through a network, with the option of playing locally or remotely. The game was created with Python and Pygame, and it features an easy and user-friendly interface, numerous difficulty levels, and support for multiple concurrent connections.
